# Research-klondaike-solitaire

• Working with Dr. Prasad Tadepalli on developing a Reinforcement learning model for Monte-Carlo planning techniques for Klondike Solitaire <br>
• Creating a Monte-Carlo tree for compressing possible actions to increase efficiency for computing possible actions <br>
• Will involve creating a deep learning model using PyTorch

NOTE: This repository does not contain the Monte Carlo Search Tree
